# ReinforcementLearning-PPO-

Implementation of PPO algorithm using the Reversi environment. In the notebook prueba-PPO we can see some results from running the alorithm with different hyperparameters. The class is in ppo.py.

Also, there are three different implementations for the same game, but with a board of 4x4. Monte Carlo Tree Search (mcts.py), Value iteration and Policy iteration (dynamic_programming.py)

If there are any suggestions please do not hesitate to communicate them!

Last thing, there is also a youtube video (in spanish) I made with explanations of the whole repository:
